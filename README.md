# Overview

This project is a small REST API built with Java and Spring Boot that manages a list of books. The API allows users to create, view, update, and delete book records. The project was designed to help me strengthen my understanding of core Java concepts like classes, collections, and service layers, while also learning how to use Spring Boot to organize and expose APIs effectively.

My goal in writing this software was to gain hands-on experience using Java in a real-world web application setting. It helped me practice building a simple backend system using best practices such as separating models, services, and controllers.
